# Jiffy

NOTE: This project has been archived. I learned a ton writing it, but at the end of the day, I don't think I can get it anywhere close to a point of stability. Also, with how good Terraform and Ansible have gotten, using those alone might be easier than setting all this up in the first place. Please do look around! There's some cool stuff here.

Jiffy is a ruby-based commandline application for automatically deploying KVM virtual machines. For more information, visit [the wiki](https://github.com/Pwpon500/Jiffy/wiki).

Jiffy requires custom Chef cookbooks for full functionality. Those can be found here:
